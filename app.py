# MyHomeApp v0.1p (2022) - Ali
# MyHome is a home management app, specifically tailored for my home.
# ===================================================================
# This first version is a prototype to see what works well and what does not.
# At this point, I am still unsure about what I want to do with this project; I don't know if I want to make it public or not, if it has to be "other-users friendly".
# I am still learning this language as I am developing this app so bugs and unoptimized code are expected. 
# I want to go with a Windows Aero-like design (Windows 7 wallpaper, WLM 2012-era, Windows Vista weather widget, glass, thin Segoe-like fonts, ...)
# === Features per version : ===
# v0.1p : design prototype
# v0.2a : networking, client/server architecture
# v0.3a : hardware integration
# v0.4a : wallpaper and weather(fixed picture, dynamic wallpaper according to the current weather)
# v0.5a : dark mode at sunset
# v0.6a : parameters charts (temperatures, humidity, ...)
# v0.7a : Ã©cowatt
